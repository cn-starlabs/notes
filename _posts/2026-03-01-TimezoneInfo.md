Time zone abbreviations can be a bit tricky because some overlap (for example, **CST** can mean Central Standard Time in the US or China Standard Time in Asia).

Here is a categorized list of the most common short names and their corresponding time zones.

## 🌎 North America (Standard & Daylight)

These are the ones you likely see most often. "Standard" is used in winter, and "Daylight" (saving) is used in summer.

| --- | --- | --- |
| **ET / CT / PT** | Eastern / Central / Pacific Time | *Generic terms used year-round* |
| **EST** | Eastern Standard Time | UTC -5 |
| **EDT** | Eastern Daylight Time | UTC -4 |
| **CST** | Central Standard Time | UTC -6 |
| **CDT** | Central Daylight Time | UTC -5 |

## 🌏 Asia & Australia

Australia has its own set of "Eastern" and "Central" abbreviations, so they usually add an 'A' at the beginning.

| Abbr. | Full Name | Common Offset |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **IST** | Indian Standard Time | UTC +5:30 |

## ⚓ Global / Technical

These are the "anchors" used for technical systems and military operations.

* **UTC (Coordinated Universal Time):** The primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It does not observe Daylight Saving.
* **GMT (Greenwich Mean Time):** Practically the same as UTC, but used more in the UK and Africa.
* **Z (Zulu Time):** Used by the military and aviation; it is identical to UTC.

> **Note:** If you are scheduling a meeting, it is often safer to use **ET** or **PT** (dropping the 'S' or 'D'). This tells people "use whatever the current local time is in that region" without you having to remember if it's currently winter or summer!

Would you like me to convert a specific time between two of these zones for you?
